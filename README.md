## Rude Swain Trod ##

*Thou shalt lie down With patriarchs of the infant world*

##Thanatopsis##

   - *William Cullen Bryant*
 
  TO HIM who in the love of Nature holds	 
Communion with her visible forms, she speaks	 
A various language; for his gayer hours	 
She has a voice of gladness, and a smile	 
And eloquence of beauty, and she glides	         5  
Into his darker musings, with a mild	 
And healing sympathy, that steals away	 
Their sharpness, ere he is aware. When thoughts	 
Of the last bitter hour come like a blight	 
Over thy spirit, and sad images	  10
Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,	 
And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,	 
Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;—	 
Go forth under the open sky, and list	 
To Nature's teachings, while from all around—	  15  
Earth and her waters, and the depths of air—	 
Comes a still voice—Yet a few days, and thee	 
The all-beholding sun shall see no more	 
In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground,	 
Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears,	  20  
Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist	 
Thy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim	 
Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again,	 
And, lost each human trace, surrendering up	 
Thine individual being, shalt thou go	  25  
To mix forever with the elements;	 
To be a brother to the insensible rock,	 
**And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain  
Turns with his share, and treads upon.** The oak	 
Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould.	  30  
  Yet not to thine eternal resting-place	 
Shalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish	 
Couch more magnificent. **Thou shalt lie down  
With patriarchs of the infant world,—with kings,**	 
The powerful of the earth,—the wise, the good,	  35  
Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,	 
All in one mighty sepulchre. The hills	 
Rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun; the vales	 
Stretching in pensive quietness between;	 
The venerable woods—rivers that move	  40  
In majesty, and the complaining brooks	 
That make the meadows green; and, poured round all,	 
Old Ocean's gray and melancholy waste,—	 
Are but the solemn decorations all	 
Of the great tomb of man! The golden sun,	  45  
The planets, all the infinite host of heaven,	 
Are shining on the sad abodes of death,	 
Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread	 
The globe are but a handful to the tribes	 
That slumber in its bosom.—Take the wings	  50  
Of morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness,	 
Or lose thyself in the continuous woods	 
Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound,	 
Save his own dashings,—yet the dead are there:	 
And millions in those solitudes, since first	  55  
The flight of years began, have laid them down	 
In their last sleep—the dead reign there alone.	 
So shalt thou rest; and what if thou withdraw	 
In silence from the living, and no friend	 
Take note of thy departure? All that breathe	  60  
Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh	 
When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care	 
Plod on, and each one as before will chase	 
His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave	 
Their mirth and their employments, and shall come	  65  
And make their bed with thee. As the long train	 
Of ages glide away, the sons of men,	 
The youth in life's green spring, and he who goes	 
In the full strength of years, matron and maid,	 
The speechless babe, and the gray-headed man—	  70  
Shall one by one be gathered to thy side	 
By those, who in their turn shall follow them.	 
  
**So live, that when thy summons comes to join	 
The innumerable caravan which moves	 
To that mysterious realm, where each shall take	  75  
His chamber in the silent halls of death,	 
Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,	 
Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed	 
By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave	 
Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch	  80  
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.**
